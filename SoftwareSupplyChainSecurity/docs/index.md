# Software Supply Chain Security

## What is Software Supply Chain?

A Software Supply Chain comprises of various components/systems used by an organization to build products and services. Every product development goes through a series of steps from idea, design, prototyping, source code, testing, packaging, delivering, distributing to deploying. As such this series consists of various systems:

* Source Control Management Systems (SCMs)
* Continuous Integration Systems (CI)
* Continuous Delivery Systems (CD)
* Continuous Deployment Systems (CD)
* Artifact Storage Systems
* Software and Infrastructure Bill of Materials (BOMs)

## What is Software Supply Chain Security?

Supply chain security is crucial to the overall security of a software product. An attacker who is able to control any step in the pipeline (build→ test→ deliver→ deploy) can alter the product for malicious intents that range from introducing backdoors in the source code to including vulnerable libraries in the final product. As a result, supply chain attacks are an impactful means for an attacker to affect multiple users/customers of a product at once.

## What is this project about?

### 1. Purpose

This project aims to bridge the gap between what a Software supply chain is, how it works, what all system/components enable a sucessful supply chain, and what are the security controls that needs to be implemented to uplift the security posture of the products/applications. This project aims to provide hands on modules and labs to learn and implement effective controls. [Learn more.](#getting-started)

### 2. Structure

This project is a series of modules to upskill you with:

* deploying a microservices based application
* understanding the core concepts of software supply chain
* deploying the systems required for a software supply chain
* deploying various security tools/utilities/processes along the way
* understand the gaps pre and post uplift of infrastructure and applications.
